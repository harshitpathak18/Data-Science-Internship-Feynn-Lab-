## Project 1: Signify - Hand Sign Recognizer

### Overview

**Signify** is the first project of my internship, designed to revolutionize communication for individuals with hearing or speech impairments. This innovative app translates hand gestures into text in real time, utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms and the Mediapipe library. Signify aims to bridge the communication gap, ensuring inclusivity and accessibility for all users.

### Features

- **Real-time Gesture Recognition:** Converts hand gestures into text instantly, facilitating smooth and natural communication.
- **High Accuracy:** Employs machine learning models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest for precise gesture recognition.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design accessible to users of all ages and technical skill levels.
- **Compatibility:** Operates on smartphones, tablets, and PCs without requiring specialized hardware.
- **Adaptability:** Functions reliably in various environments and lighting conditions.

### Technology Stack

- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** KNN, SVM, Random Forest
- **Libraries and Frameworks:** Mediapipe for hand tracking and gesture detection
- **Programming Languages:** Python for model development and integration
- **User Interface:** Developed using cross-platform frameworks for broad compatibility
