Welcome to the repository for my Data Science Internship projects. This repository contains all files, reports, and documentation related to my work during the internship. Throughout this internship, I have focused on developing practical applications using advanced data science and machine learning techniques. Each project aims to solve real-world problems, showcasing the skills and knowledge I have gained.


## Project 1: Signify - Hand Sign Recognizer
**Signify** is the flagship project of my Data Science Internship, crafted to revolutionize communication for individuals with hearing or speech impairments. This cutting-edge app translates hand gestures into text in real-time, leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and the Mediapipe library. Signify aims to bridge the communication gap, ensuring inclusivity and accessibility for all users.
